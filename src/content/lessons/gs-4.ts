    "COERLL, Yorùbá Yé Mi (University of Texas at Austin), Chapter 1, Lesson 3 \"Subject Pronouns\", pages 37 to 38: regular forms mo, o, ó, a, ẹ, wọ́n; emphatic forms èmi, ìwọ, òun, àwa, ẹ̀yin, àwọn; Èmi ńkọ́? correct and Mo ńkọ́? incorrect; ẹ and wọ́n as pronouns of respect; Mo lọ = I went. The PDF uses a legacy font, so the tone marks were decoded by hand.",
    "Wiktionary, Yoruba personal pronoun table (shown on the \"wọn\" entry): the same short and long forms.",
    "Wiktionary, \"o\", \"mo\", \"ẹ\" (Yoruba sections): o is mid tone (you), ó is high tone (he, she, it), ẹ is plural or honorific you.",
    "Wiktionary, \"lọ\" (Yoruba section): lọ, mid tone, to go.",
    "Changed from the brief: COERLL translates Mo lọ as \"I went\", not \"I go\", and lists Èmí lọ as correct, so the brief's mistake (Èmi lọ) was replaced. Not cross-checked against a print grammar.",

      { id: "short-forms", title: "Short forms", explanation: "The short forms sit right before the verb: Mo lọ, I went. Ó lọ, he went. With a verb like lọ (go), the plain verb tells you something already happened." },
      { id: "long-forms", title: "Long forms", explanation: "Each pronoun also has a long form: èmi, ìwọ, òun, àwa, ẹ̀yin, àwọn. Use the long form when no verb follows, as in Èmi ńkọ́? (How about me?). It can also stress who did it." },
      { id: "o-tones", title: "o or ó", explanation: "o with no mark (mid tone) is \"you\". ó with a high mark is \"he\", \"she\", or \"it\". Only the tone tells them apart." },
      { id: "respect", title: "Pronouns of respect", explanation: "ẹ is \"you\" for a group, and also for one older person. wọ́n is \"they\", and is also used for one respected elder, such as your father." },
